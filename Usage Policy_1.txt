	  <center><font face="arial" color="white" size="5">Our Original Releases are Free To Use & Free To Monetize. 
These videos have the title “8D ANIIMS”</font></center><br>
	  
	  <center><font face="arial" color="white" size="5">Our NCS Releases and Co-Releases with other labels are
 NOT Monetizable. These videos have the title “8D ANIIMS”</font></center><br>
	  
	  <center><font face="arial" color="white" size="5">In order to combat & prevent fake claims, we have decided to
 enable Content ID. All content creator will still be able to 
use & monetize except the content creator will need to dispute 
each claim. You will get a claim from my distributor
 “Repost Network” or “The District”. Please dispute the claim with
 this code: “I have properly credited NSC Release on my video.
” The claim will be released within 1-2 days and you can monetize 
the video yourself. Also, you won’t lose any revenue that’s made
 between the claim and the release. YouTube holds it in an escrow 
account for you.</font></center><br><br><br>
	  
	  <center><font face="arial" color="white" size="9"><u>HOW TO DISPUTE THE CLAIM?</u></font></center><br><br><br>

 claim > Monetization > View Details > Select Action > Dispute</font></center><br>
	  
	  <center><font face="arial" color="white" size="5">Select “My dispute isn't based on any of the reasons above. I would
 still like to dispute this Content ID claim” > click “Continue” > Select 
“License” > Click “Continue” > Check “I have permission to use the

	  <center><font face="arial" color="white" size="9"><u>EXCEPTIONS</u></font></center><br><br><br>
	  
	  <center><font face="arial" color="white" size="5">1) You will be claimed if you don’t PROPERLY GIVE CREDIT to our
 music.</font></center><br>
	  
	   <center><font face="arial" color="white" size="5">Solution: Properly add credits to the description of your video.
 Then dispute the video by writing: “I have properly added the 
missing credits (Artist Name - Song Name) to my video.”</font></center><br>
	  
	  <center><font face="arial" color="white" size="5">2)You will be claimed if the video ALREADY HAVE MULTIPLE 
CLAIMS by other companies.</font></center><br>
	  
	  <center><font face="arial" color="white" size="5">Why do we do this? If you have 1 claim or more than 1 claim on your
 video, you no longer can monetize your video. The 3rd party 
claimant will take all the revenue which makes no sense since 
they are also taking a % of NCS Release’s share.</font></center><br>
	  
	  <center><font face="arial" color="white" size="5">Solution:  Remove the other claims first. Then dispute the video 
by writing: “NCS Releases is the only claim left on this video. 
Please remove the claim.”</font></center><br>
	  
	  <center><font face="arial" color="white" size="5">3) You will be claimed if it’s a NCS. Covers are not 
free to monetize but you can use the song without worry of   
copyright strikes.</font></center><br>
	  
	  <center><font face="arial" color="white" size="5">4) You will be claimed if you are a Music Mix Youtube Channel. This 
is for creators who uses a bunch of our songs to create music
 mixes. You will need a commercial license. Please send
